# SyncFusion

Remarks: For now implemented only for 1 PDF file.


Task:

A simple WPF application where the user can upload multiple PDF files and CSV file. The goal of the application is to load the PDF files and find in these PDF files data from the CSV file.

In this project, we will use controls from Syncfusion, so I request their usage here. For reading PDF files, you can use the PdfViewer control, which has a suitable method for extracting text - this is described in the documentation: https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/pdf-viewer/extract-text-from-pdf

Please provide the task in the form of a Git repository - your work in Git will also be evaluated - including your commit practices and so on.
